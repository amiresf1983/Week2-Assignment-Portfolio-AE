    <h1>ABOUT ME!</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        I am a professional with an extensive background in project coordination
        and engineering within the telco & construction industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Facilitating end to end project lifecycles, I oversee planning,
        procurement, technical design development, costing, subcontractor
        management, client negotiations and review of project progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delivering quality and innovative project solutions enables me to drive
        cost savings consistently.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about working with multidisciplinary teams. I am looking
        for a new opportunity to deliver quality projects on time whilst
        exceeding deliverables as well as balancing client and business
        objectives.
