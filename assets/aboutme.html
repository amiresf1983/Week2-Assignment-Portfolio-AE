<h1>ABOUT ME!</h1>
<p>
  I am a professional with an extensive background in project coordination and
  engineering within the telco & construction industries. Facilitating end to
  end project lifecycles, I oversee planning, procurement, technical design
  development, costing, subcontractor management, client negotiations and review
  of project progress. Delivering quality and innovative project solutions
  enables me to drive cost savings consistently. I am passionate about working
  with multidisciplinary teams. I am looking for a new opportunity to deliver
  quality projects on time whilst exceeding deliverables as well as balancing
  client and business objectives.
